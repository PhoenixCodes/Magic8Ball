# Magic8Ball
####Goal
To output a random answer, as would the child's toy called a 'magic 8 ball'.
####Execution
This program is just made to log a random answer to the console. Simply 'think' a question at it, execute it, and wait for your answer!

####About this program
##### Hello world
This is a sort of 'hello world' style program, just intended to have some of the very basics of JavaScript. It takes no inputs, and has a random output, after outputing an ASCII art 8ball and moving it up and down.

##### Inspiration
I noticed a 'pro' course in CodeAcademy for making an 8ball script with JS. Since I wasn't going to pay for the course, I decided to make it from scratch on my own, with my own challenges:
- A multi-line string of an 8 ball ascii art
- Function to 'shake' the ball, as well as randomizing the amount it gets shaken
- Random response from the program, modifiable just by adding to or subtracting from the array
- Functions for running so it can later be implemented into something else with little difficulty, instead of just running in console

#####Features to be added in future
- integration into an html page
- 8 ball images
- answer inside 8 ball instead of after it
